## How to Run the Project Locally  

### 1. Install the Required Libraries  

Before running the script, make sure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed. You can find the required libraries at the beginning of **final_disney_analysis.py** and install them manually using:  

```sh
pip install <library_name>
```  

### 2. Run the Script  

Once the libraries are installed, execute the script with:  

```sh
python final_disney_analysis.py
```  

This will generate an **HTML report** with the latest stock data.  

### 3. Open the Report  

After running the script, open the generated **HTML file** in a web browser to view the analysis.
